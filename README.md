# Dotted-image

This is a Python implementation of some algorithms for Poisson disk samplings.

To use this script, call `./dotted-image [input] [output]` where `[input]` is the path to the input image and `[output]` is the path for the output image.

### Example

![Input image](/path/to/image.png "A very famous robot")

![Output image](/path/to/image.png "This looks like an image of a very famous robot")
